        <h2>A BRIEF INTRODUCTION ON KUALA KANGSAR.</h2>
        <p>The water flow along the edge of the Perak River from the high-water mark in Ulu Belum to its estuary in Southern Melaka gave rise to the state of Perak. People have been drawn to the qualities of this river from its inception and have chosen to journey through it in search of a suitable bank to land on. They were the explorers who came to establish new regions, interacted with the aborigines, and eventually evolved into the Perak people we see today.</p>
        <p>They travelled by sampan till they came to a creek on the Perak River's left bank. They thought the river's confluence juncture was acceptable, given the river's low banks, lush terrain, and scenic outlook. This river, known as 'Kuala Kurang Sa,' is one less than the hundredth, according to their calculations (Confluence less one). KUALA KURANG SA, which was then referred to as merely Kuala Kangsar, was apparently its original name.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Kuala Kangsar is a provision of quality for habitation, farming, and a business centre, in addition to being a superb landing spot. On land, one can continue their trek until they reach Gunung Pondok, which serves as a signpost for travellers travelling to and from Larut.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Kuala Kangsar, also known as Perak's royal town, is situated downstream of the Kangsar River, where it meets the Perak River. Kuala Kangsar was the site of some of Malaysia's most pivotal events. It was the birthplace of Malaysia's rubber industry and the site of the first Durbar – the convention of Malay Sultans – in 1897. It was also the initial foothold of the British, who tried to rule the peninsula by posting Residents at the royal courts in the 1870s.</p>
